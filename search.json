    "text": "Strengths\nGIS are composed of layers of data sets and are mainly used for mapping, georeferencing, and data analysis (e.g. spatial analysis). The data can be varied in what it represents but must be linked to spatial parameters for it to be positioned in a visualization for analysis of spatial information (Wheatley and Gillings 2005, 1, 8). GIS layers for historical studies can be viewed as models of data sets. They represent specific topics in time and space simplistically, and spark reflection (Van Ruymbeke 2021, 8). The screen shot of my QGIS workspace (Figure 1) shows the city of Marseille with parks marked in various stages of planning in the early 1970s. This was the time when longstanding Mayor Gaston Defferre launched the large-scale greening initiative Mille Points Verts pour Marseille (Gassier 1971). Defferre and his team’s goal was to react to a growing ecological awareness and increase the number of green spaces for a more livable city (Chelini 1971). They also organized events to include and educate citizens and to garner their support for the upcoming elections (Anonymous 1971). The majority of parks created within Mille Points Verts remain until today, with only a handful of additional parks added after the mid-1970s. This is visible when the layer with parks and gardens from a 2018 dataset provided by the government of Marseille is selected (Figure 2). The strength of GIS layering is evident when we apply distant reading techniques: skimming over the model we see a display of spatial relations of park distribution and location as well as their connection to time.  In order for this visualization to take shape, I produced and assembled data. Specifically, I selected data and went through the process of closely reading my historical sources, learning to understand them and to think through their meaning. In this way maps are social documents. By themselves, they do not reveal anything yet. But by superimposing visualizations, GIS can reveal thinking processes of the data curators and map creators (cf. for example C. Jones 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Planned parks (1970-71) within the ‘Mille Points Verts’ initiative.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) This image can be deceiving as it seems that many parks do not overlap. Figure 1 shows approximate planning locations. The 2018 state of parks therefore shows the current locations of many of the planned ones from 1970-71.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2",

    "section": "Weaknesses",
    "text": "Weaknesses\nThe curation of data, although an important and empowering step for the historian and GIS researcher, also reveals the weaknesses of GIS: the mismatch between GIS requirements (in terms of data structuring and quality) and the imperfection of historical data. GIS software is created for geographers, not historians. Everything in GIS is structured data and therefore cannot handle ambiguities natural to historical sources. Sources in whatever form they are collected by the historian first must be organized, selected, tabularized, geocoded and/or georeferenced (Kemp 2009, 16–17). The caveat here is that a historian’s data is hardly ever complete. Missing records shape both what we can and cannot analyze – especially when working with GIS. In historical narration on text the researcher can explain gaps and postulate why this may be the case. GIS do not allow for gaps and thus we can only produce models and visualizations with the numerical evidence available.\nThe visualization presented here helps to model different states of an object: the park. As my data is not complete, discrepancies between the mapped data and the on-the-ground reality occur, especially since the planned parks had vague names sometimes only matching the name of an entire neighborhood. This raises the question of how to capture temporality. How can the aspect of time appear on a two-dimensional visualization? Rendering the time layer onto the spatial one demands creativity and an awareness that time is something constructed (Massey speaks of “implicit imaginations of time and space” Massey 2005, 22).\nFrom the map making perspective, time significantly impacts the creation process. GIS work is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It involves meticulous manual searching, assembling, and layering of data. However, linking to the overarching topic of this conference, AI may offer new possibilities. Tools such as Transkribus allow users to apply machine learning to filter specific elements from document sets. LLMs can then process this information into CSV files for GIS software. While not yet revolutionary, as these tools evolve, AI could become useful in extracting numerical evidence from textual sources. For geocoding of places, AI would greatly aid efficiency and relieve the researcher of tedious manual work. However, at this point, LLMs such as Claude AI and ChatGPT still hallucinate considerably.",

    "section": "Opportunities",
    "text": "Opportunities\nAI-assisted data extraction presents a gateway to think about opportunities. Researchers could focus more on experimenting with design and layering by automating time-consuming tasks. For example, mapping supports spatial thinking and perception by integrating the crucial ‘where’ element: Where are specific features located? How near or far is one place from another? Depending on what obstacles or facilitators are in place a park may be close in measured distance but far in terms of accessibility if there is no bridge or tunnel to e.g. cross a motorway, or water element. Therefore, how are different locations related? How can we perceive and understand distance?\nThe screenshot here shows a handful of ‘wheres’ (Figure 3). They reveal where the majority of parks are located, their proximity to neighborhoods, the types of surrounding communities, and their connections to amenities and public infrastructure. This approach enables comparisons across different scales. For instance, I can compare park distribution between Hamburg and Marseille and track their development over time.  These questions prompted by the use of GIS direct both user and observer back to the original sources for close reading. A GIS model can spark interest in a topic and motivate the researcher to dig deeper on what these layers mean and how they were created. Ideally GIS should be used as a starting point for in depth analysis. In the case of Marseille and Hamburg, the development of public urban green spaces was what inspired me to look more closely at the historical circumstances. Hamburg, for instance, has a long history of creating expansive green areas with the support of private patrons. Marseille does not have a comparable patronage system. Instead, municipal expropriation rendered private villas and their gardens public.\nGIS are a powerful tool that serve multiple functions in research (Wheatley and Gillings 2005, 8). They “can play a role in generating ideas and hypotheses at the beginning of a project” and serve as valuable instruments for analysis and evaluation (Brewer 2006, S36). By modeling research hypotheses and findings, e.g. maps can be used to effectively communicate to diverse audiences – from the general public to specialized groups such as urban planners and municipal governments, relevant to my field of historical urban planning research.\nA particularly compelling aspect of GIS is their ability to visually represent power relations (Figure 4). This feature bridges the gap between historical analysis and contemporary urban planning, making it an invaluable tool in understanding the evolution of urban spaces. The visualization of Marseille reveals that the majority of parks are located towards the center and south of the city and does not necessarily correspond to the population density. The south of Marseille is where villas abound and thus the upper and upper-middle class live. The majority of the HLM (housing at moderate rent) are located towards the north, where living conditions are condensed, and political representation is low. What is more, if I select the layers showing where most immigrants and workers live today, a lack of green spaces is visible (Figure 5) (Figure 6) (Figure 7).  Connecting this once more to close reading of the sources: when Mille Points Verts was launched, planners scavenged locations for green space creation. The HLM neighborhoods were marked as unsuitable for participation in this program: People living in social housing would “misuse” the parks by playing soccer on them or walking across the grass (Anonymous 1970). This shows complexity of space perception and power imbalance (Van Ruymbeke 2021, 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Zoom in on the harbor area where also the “pénétrante nord” is located (built in the late 1960s). Along this main road many parks were planned but not built.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Population 2012 layer turned on (natural breaks). This visualization presents a caveat: the northern part does not appear densely populated. This is not the case as the northern neighborhoods are very hilly, thus HLM apartment blocks house a large number of people in a small space.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Zoom in on harbor area.

    "section": "Threats",
    "text": "Threats\nYet all these opportunities are ambiguous and “entrusting machines with the memory of human activity can be frightening”. The last element of the SWOT analysis, threats, rounds off these reflections. Although it is crucial to encourage critical thinking through the mapping of, for example, political representation and wealth distribution of a city it also shows my personal convictions. I wish to demonstrate which voices where not heard in the planning of these spaces, which people were not considered when decisions were made. I am biased when I start with the premise that there is inequality. The map, objective as it may seem, never is. The book How to Lie with Maps provocatively shows the power of maps to create a strong, and perhaps deceiving, narrative:\n“Map users generally are a trusting lot: they understand the need to distort geometry and suppress features, and they believe the cartographer really does know where to draw the line, figuratively as well as literally. […] Yet cartographers are not licensed, and many mapmakers competent in commercial art or the use of computer workstations have never studied cartography. Map users seldom, if ever, question these authorities, and they often fail to appreciate the map’s power as a tool of deliberate falsification or subtle propaganda” (Monmonier 1996, 1).\n\nPeople working with GIS can have all kinds of skill levels and interests. I, for example, am not a GIS specialist and relatively new to using the tool. Still, I can easily manipulate my model to paint various pictures, if I wish to do so. I can turn on different layers and focus on the number of immigrants per neighborhood, I can change the classification for the choropleth map and create entirely different impressions, or I can simply change the basemap and take away the context of terrain, transportation systems, etc. (cf. Figure 4). The quote speaks of an almost blind trust in maps, which shows once more that we must always be critical observers of the things we consume and historians should always want to be curios fact checkers.  A map is a series of decisions and it reflects the biography of both the maker and the observer. It is the responsibility of the historian working with GIS to be as transparent as possible regarding the choices made to display a historical development or state. It is the responsibility of the observer to use the map as a starting point for close reading, interpretation and analysis rather than the end point and a fact. We must remember “80% of GIS is about transforming, manipulating and managing spatial data”(C. E. Jones and Schiel 2022).",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion the use of GIS in historical research and analysis requires the researcher to stay true to the principles of the craft of the historian: source criticism, the ability to subsume information, create a strong narrative, document the process of source manipulation and proper source citation. As historians we should be aware of the power of storytelling – no matter which medium we use. An audience’s spatial understanding can be enhanced via GIS models, serving as a support system of sorts. All the more reason why GIS in historical analysis must be used and consumed critically and consciously. By embracing this complexity, we can use GIS for historical reflections, enhancing our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics in historical contexts.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scholars and interested laypeople who want to adequately deal with historical topics or generally extract information from differently structured historical documents need both knowledge of old scripts and methods for analysing complex layouts. Studies of written artefacts are only possible if they can be read at all – written in unfamiliar scripts such as Gothic Cursive, Humanist Minuscule or German Kurrent and sometimes with rather unconventional layouts. Until now, the relevant skills have been developed, for example, by the highly specialised field of palaeography. In the last few years, a shift in practice has taken place.

    "text": "Scholars and interested laypeople who want to adequately deal with historical topics or generally extract information from differently structured historical documents need both knowledge of old scripts and methods for analysing complex layouts. Studies of written artefacts are only possible if they can be read at all – written in unfamiliar scripts such as Gothic Cursive, Humanist Minuscule or German Kurrent and sometimes with rather unconventional layouts. Until now, the relevant skills have been developed, for example, by the highly specialised field of palaeography. In the last few years, a shift in practice has taken place. With digital transcription tools based on deep learning models trained to read these old scripts and accompanying layouts on the rise, working with old documents or unusual layouts is becoming easier and quicker.

    "text": "Teaching ATR online – the setting\nDigital methods allow a more comprehensive range of users to assign, analyse and interpret sources digitally. This increased availability of data (mainly in the form of digitized images) also protects the original documents. Recognising handwriting with the help of machine learning, known as ATR, has been greatly improved and is becoming increasingly important in various disciplines. Machine learning methods, especially deep learning, have been used for complex evaluation decisions for a number of years.(Muehlberger et al. 2019) For text recognition, especially for recognising handwriting, ATR can achieve far better results than conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, many non-standardised fonts and layouts will lead to high error rates in the recognition processes, which is why it is essential to clean up data manually. The reading order of individual lines or blocks of text, in particular, poses major challenges for machine transcription tools.\nEven ATR itself presents several hurdles; the existing tools are often only intuitive to use to a limited extent. Due to the error rates described above, cleaning up the automatically recognized texts by hand is essential. New users must familiarise themselves with these processes, whether this is on their own at home or in a mentored university or non-academic course. In addition, text recognition itself is only part of the learning curve: to work independently with ATR, it is also necessary to recognise when which form of text and layout recognition makes sense, where it is worth investing time to save more time later on and how to proceed with the output. For these reasons, the ongoing DIZH project PATT (Potentials of Advanced Text Technologies: Machine Learning-based Text Recognition)(UZH 2024) at the University of Zurich and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences is currently developing an open-source e-learning module teaching students, young researchers, and the interested public (in the sense of citizen science) how to use ATR.\nDeveloping an exhaustive learning module is a desideratum, as many researchers working in history or linguistics today want to work with automated text and layout recognition. This complex digital skill set involves the critical categorisation of the machine’s feedback. Although the steps involved in manuscript reading are becoming more efficient, they also require new skills: the work no longer centres on direct engagement with handwriting or print, but on the efficient and task-appropriate correction of the results of automated text and layout recognition, often bringing in the original sources later in for a combined distant and close reading.\nThe learning module will be published on Ad fontes. This e-learning tool has been helping researchers to prepare for their work in the archive for around 20 years.(Kränzle and Ritter 2004) It consists of exercises and tutorials that introduce researchers to different types of sources and techniques used to transcribe and analyse them. The platform was completely revised in autumn 2018, meets current standards, and is designed to be interactive to provide a good learning experience.(Hodel and Nadig 2019) The platform has attracted a great deal of attention, both within Switzerland and internationally. Ad fontes’ open access policy (modules are published under a Creative Commons license) ensures that the new module will not be hidden behind a paywall or disappear from the WWW after a short time. The Ad fontes e-learning project is based at the Chair of Medieval History of Prof. Dr. Simon Teuscher.",

    "text": "When and how to use ATR for a specific project\nClear target groups and precise learning objectives have been defined for the learning module. As a first step in this direction, we involved experts in the PATT project, defining the following two target groups: First, people with no experience with ATR and the corresponding software and platforms; second, scholars who are already informed about the principles but would like to expand their knowledge systematically and targeted. Our general learning objective is to convey how ATR can be used in a time-efficient, project-specific manner without the recognition process becoming a time waster.\nThe new e-learning module will consist of three parts: (1) What and why ATR?, (2) When is ATR useful? (3) How do I use ATR precisely for my work? The first chapter leads new users into the topic of ATR, OCR and HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition), deep learning, and the most prominent platforms and software. The second chapter draws up various application scenarios a student could find themselves in by showing best practices. This chapter speaks on the research aims as well as the ‘quality’ and quantity of sources. The third chapter is based on these application scenarios and shows signposts for each of the identified applications.\nChapters 2 and 3 will contain the project’s greatest contributions: The aim is to show, from the perspective of historical scholarship, how the prerequisites of the corpora used and the project’s own objective influence how we can use ATR sensibly. From a research perspective, the usefulness of using ATR in this way can be determined primarily by whether it saves time when cataloguing and reading documents. For example, if there are many different manuscripts in a corpus, it is more or less time-efficient, depending on the number of documents, to find a suitable HTR model with a low error rate or to, alternatively, train a model independently. Correction and production of ground truths is a factor to be considered. The amount of text to be transcribed plays a decisive role at this stage: If only a few pages need to be transcribed (depending on the size of the project, “a few” could be 5 or 100), a manual transcription often makes more sense. What constitutes a “good” transcription also varies depending on the research requirements of the corpus: If only individual sections (e.g., certain persons or concepts) in a larger corpus are of interest for the research question, a transcription with a character error rate (CER) of up to 10% may be sufficient to identify those text passages (e.g., with keyword spotting or full text search). Being able to quickly filter out relevant text passages from imperfectly transcribed text volumes promises a relevant expansion of the source base that can potentially be considered, even for smaller research projects. If your own research question is interested in the entire text – a close-reading – a significantly lower CER is necessary to be able to read the text. Both, when it comes to identifying relevant text passages and when analysing smaller text parts for close reading, the reading skills of ATR users are still indispensable, as specific parts of a digitized image need to be consulted. However, also here ATR can be very useful as a first step in a larger process.\nWe use a spider diagram model to communicate the various influences on the benefits of ATR for your own project. This provides a visual representation of various factors that influence work with ATR. The four factors we identified are: (1) the heterogeneity of hands, i.e. the variety of handwriting in the texts; (2) the amount of text; (3) the method, this refers to the types of analysis distant reading and close reading on a sliding scale; (4) the research question; respectively its narrowness or breadth.\n\n\n\nOur model showing identified factors for the use of ATR in historical projects\n\n\nA high heterogeneity of handwriting could affect the accuracy of ATR as the recognition software might have difficulties to recognize the text consistently. A higher degree of heterogeneity requires a broader model based on larger amount of training data.(Hodel et al. 2021) Large amounts of text often mean that ATR needs to be able to work efficiently and scalable to process large amounts of data. For small amounts of text, the focus could be on the level of detail of the recognition or more manual correction. A close reading would require a more precise and detailed analysis of the texts, which means that the ATR models must be accurate and able to recognize fine details, while distant reading focuses more on the recognition of patterns and trends. A broad research question might require a general analysis of many texts, which means that the ATR models should be versatile and robust (e.g. based on TrOCR models)(Li et al. 2022). A specific research question might mean the ATR must focus on specific details and accurate detections. In summary, working with ATR requires a careful balance between the quantity and type of texts, the desired accuracy and detail of the analysis, and the heterogeneity of the manuscripts to be analysed. The diagram helps to organise these factors visually and to understand their interactions.",

Some of this software requires licence or operates on a pay-per-use basis and is therefore not a viable option for everyone. When referring to these products, our open-source teaching module also provides free advertising for paid tools. On the other hand, free tools have disadvantages, which means they are not helpful in all cases. We, therefore, must find a good balance between these two poles. In the technical realisation of our teaching module, we are limited by the options developed during the relaunch. We, therefore, must develop our teaching module within the structures of the existing options. We would furthermore like to set up a FAQ page on ATR, but this requires us to be able to collect and identify these problems and questions systematically.",

    "text": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 19 November 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nA secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\nby the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a “Source” link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0",
